# Tasks outstanding

1. Currently using on-demand mean and SD. See if live update is still doable.

2. If user inputs "1 2", it fills next input with "2".
	Example, from main menu, user can just type "1 1 1" and it goes directly to 2D rectangle.
	
3. Set dimensions input range limit (Currently no limit. Change to 0 < x < 100)
